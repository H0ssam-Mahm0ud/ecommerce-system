A fully-featured e-commerce system built using ASP.NET MVC. The application demonstrates my expertise in developing scalable and secure web applications, with the following features:

Integrated jQuery to enhance usability with real-time Toaster notifications for actions like adding, editing, or deleting categories/products.

Utilized the Repository Pattern and Unit of Work to achieve Separation of Concerns, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

-Authentication & Authorization:
Leveraged ASP.NET Identity to implement secure role-based access control with roles like Admin, Editor, and Customer. Restricted access to admin features while allowing customers to interact with their carts and orders.

Designed a robust shopping cart where customers can add, update, and remove items.

-Stripe Payment Integration:
Integrated Stripe for secure and seamless payment processing, enabling customers to complete their purchases with confidence.
